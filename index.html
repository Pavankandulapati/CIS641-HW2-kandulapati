        <div class="project">
            <h3>Diabetes Risk Prediction System</h3>
            <p>In our project, we're tackling the important issue of diabetes, a common but often poorly understood health problem affecting many people worldwide. Our main goal is to use data science and machine learning to predict if someone might have diabetes. This can help with early detection and better healthcare.

                We're using a type of machine learning called classification. We've tested different methods like K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine, and the K-Nearest Neighbors model worked best for predicting diabetes.
                
                To do this, we need a bunch of data about people, including things like their age, gender, family health history, lifestyle choices (like diet and exercise), and medical test results (especially blood sugar levels). We get this data from sources like public health records, anonymous medical files, and surveys we've made.
                
                Our process involves collecting and exploring data, choosing the best model, creating a report, thorough testing, and possibly using the model in healthcare. We aim to help with early diabetes detection and better healthcare. The technologies we're using are Data Science and Machine Learning.</p>
